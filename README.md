# Soil-Moisture-Senor
Soil Moisture Sensor


In this project, a capacitive soil moisture sensor was created to accurately measure the soil moisture to +/- 1.5% of the direct measurement. 

The capacitive sensor was fabricated and designed for this purpose, and the code used a learning machine with a regression model to provide extremely accurate measurements of the medium's moisture.
